This file is a placeholder to ensure the models directory exists.
The application will create a basic mannequin using THREE.js primitives if no mannequin.glb file is found.

To use a custom 3D mannequin model:
1. Place your model file named "mannequin.glb" in this directory
2. Make sure the model is properly formatted as a glTF/GLB file
3. The model should be in a T-pose or A-pose for best results
