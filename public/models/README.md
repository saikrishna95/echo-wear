# 3D Mannequin Model

To use a custom 3D mannequin model, place your model file here as `mannequin.glb`.

## Requirements

- The file must be named exactly `mannequin.glb`
- The model should be a humanoid figure in T-pose or A-pose
- For best results, use a model with basic materials
- The model origin should be at the feet level
- The model's height should be approximately 2 units

## Where to find models

You can find suitable 3D mannequin models from these sources:

1. [CGTrader](https://www.cgtrader.com/free-3d-models/character/clothing/mannequin-3d-model-1)
2. [Sketchfab](https://sketchfab.com/search?q=mannequin&type=models)
3. [TurboSquid](https://www.turbosquid.com/Search/Index.cfm?keyword=mannequin&media_typeid=2)

## Troubleshooting

If your model doesn't appear:
- Ensure the file is named exactly `mannequin.glb`
- Check that the model isn't too large (under 5MB recommended)
- Verify that the model is correctly exported in glTF/GLB format

If no model is found, the application will automatically use a simple primitive-based mannequin.
